### 🌟 About Me
I'm studying to become a software engineer navigating through constellations of code mainly in **C++** - that's the language I speak. I've also tried my hand at frontend and have a little experience in website layout. Got a lot of things that I'm willing to try in the near future besides what I already mentioned!

- 🌐 I hail from **Moscow, Russia**.
- 🎓 Currently enhancing my skills at **the Moscow State Technical University**.
- 🌠 (un)Fun fact: I have a bunch of other hobbies and it will take me forever to write about them, so I'd rather not 👀

### 💻 Featured Project: Device Assistant
Together with my team, we're currently developing a cutting-edge project for our college course, aptly named **Device Assistant**. This innovative application is designed to:

- 🔍 Analyze user's hardware specifications and suggest potential upgrades
- 💡 Simplify the process of choosing hardware upgrades or a new setup, tailored to the user's budget and intended use
- 🧠 Leverage the power of GPT-4 to provide intelligent recommendations

At the moment, the repository is private as we're in the thick of development. We're excited to announce that we plan to launch the first open alpha version in early 2024, just in time for our project showcase in April 2024!
